They are the shape of the journey itself - of mind, body, and spirit moving through challenge and change. </p><p>The mountains on our packaging reflect this rhythm. Peaks mark the moments we pause - to honour what we’ve built, to breathe in what we’ve become. They’re not endpoints, but perspectives - places of clarity before the next ascent.  </p><p>And the valleys? They’re where growth deepens - where we leave behind the comfort of the known, and build resilience, one quiet step at a time.  Together, these rises and falls remind us: the journey doesn’t end. It carries on - shaping us, step by step, into who we’re meant to become.</p>",

These colours are not chosen at random - they reflect the essence of the flavour while symbolising the deeper meaning behind the wellness journey. Together, they tell a story of grounding, growth, celebration, and inspiration.</p><p>1. Earth-Brown: Chocolate Mousse Flavour • Grounding and Stability (At the Base of the Mountain)</p><p>Chocolate represents the start of the journey, where we plant our feet firmly on the ground. It’s a stage of quiet strength - where we gather our energy and begin to build trust in ourselves and the path ahead. This is the soil where growth begins, nurturing the foundation for every step to come.</p><p>2. Grass-Green: Unflavoured Flavour • Growth and Curiosity (The Ascent Begins)</p><p>Green marks the next step - where grounded strength becomes motion. This is the stage of curiosity, of trying things out, and learning through doing.  It’s less about getting it right, and more about staying open and moving forward - one step at a time. There’s no fixed path. No perfect formula. Just the willingness to explore, adjust, and grow through experience.  Momentum is built here - not by force, but by choice. </p><p>3. Vibrant Purple: Mixed Berry Flavour • Celebration and Presence (A Breath at the Peak)</p><p>Purple marks the next stage – where you pause and savour what you’ve built: the effort, the clarity, the climb. You feel it now - the vibrancy in your body and the energy that comes from doing the work.  This is a celebration - not of perfection, or of a final destination, but of progress, and the path itself.  You take a breath and let it all sink in, before you continue the journey.</p><p>4. Sky-Blue: Smooth Vanilla Flavour • Reflection and Renewal (The Quiet Summit)</p><p>Blue represents the next stage - where motion surrenders to stillness. You’ve climbed, adjusted, and grown. Now, you pause - not to finish, but to reflect.  This is a moment to breathe, to feel the space you’ve created, to notice what’s shifted, and to recognise the strength that brought you here.  There’s nothing to chase now. Only to feel the quiet presence of where you are.  This stage is not an ending - it’s a quiet renewal, before the next stage unfolds.</p>",
